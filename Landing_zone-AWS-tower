WHAT is AWS Landing Zone?

An AWS Landing Zone is a ready-made, secure, and well-organized AWS environment that helps companies start building in the cloud quickly and safely.
It sets up multiple AWS accounts, security rules, network design, and logging ‚Äî all automatically.

---Real-World Example:-----
Imagine we're starting a new company.
Instead of renting an empty office and setting up electricity, internet, security, furniture, etc. yourself ‚Äî

you choose a ready-to-use co-working space like WeWork.
‚úÖ Already has Wi-Fi
‚úÖ Security is in place
‚úÖ Meeting rooms are ready
‚úÖ Printers, desks, access cards ‚Äî all done
You just move in and start working.

-- AWS Version of That:

Landing Zone is like that pre-configured office ‚Äî
but for your AWS cloud setup.
‚úÖ Multiple AWS accounts
‚úÖ Security rules (like firewalls, encryption)
‚úÖ Network already designed
‚úÖ Logging, monitoring, and compliance setup

You just deploy your apps ‚Äî no heavy setup needed.

--------Before Landing Zone:------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: Imagine we have 3 AWS accounts for dev, test, and prod. Each account is set up manually with separate security settings, cost tracking, and network configuration.
Drawbacks:
Hard to manage security and costs across all accounts.
Scaling up (e.g., adding a new environment) takes time and effort.
Risk of inconsistent settings.
Manual Configuration: Time-consuming and error-prone setup.
Inconsistent Policies: Security gaps due to different settings.
Cost Tracking Issues: Hard to manage expenses across accounts.
Limited Automation: Difficult to automate tasks across environments.
Increased Complexity: More configuration and management overhead.
Compliance Challenges: Ensuring uniform policy enforcement.
Scaling Problems: Time-consuming to add new environments.
Management Overhead: More accounts means more to maintain.
Troubleshooting Difficulty: Harder to diagnose issues across accounts.
Best Practice Challenges: Hard to implement uniform security and monitoring.

--------After Landing Zone:------
Example: With Landing Zone, you set up your AWS accounts in an organized way using AWS Organizations. Security, cost tracking, and networking are automatically managed across all accounts.
Benefits:
Centralized security, cost tracking, and compliance.
Easy to scale by adding new accounts or services.
Reduced manual effort, ensuring everything is consistent and secure.

main addded benifts is Cost Savings:--
By consolidating accounts under a Landing Zone, you can achieve better volume discounts on AWS services
(like EC2, S3, and EBS), as AWS gives discounts when usage is spread across linked accounts in an 
organization. This can significantly reduce costs compared to managing multiple isolated accounts.

so,
Why we use Landing Zone:

Easier Account Management:
AWS Organizations: Helps organize and manage multiple accounts in one place.

Better Security:
IAM & SCP: Automatically apply security rules to control access and permissions.

Automated Compliance:
AWS Config & Security Hub: Track and monitor compliance with regulations automatically.

Cost Savings:
Cost Explorer & Budgets: Get volume discounts and track spending across accounts.

Centralized Control:
AWS Control Tower: Manage security, compliance, and resources from a single dashboard.

Faster Scaling:
CloudFormation & AWS Organizations: Easily add new accounts and services as you grow.

Less Manual Work:
Service Catalog & Control Tower: Automate resource setup to avoid errors and save time.

******Items as Prerequisites ‚Äì Asking the Right Questions (To Ask Clients at Project Start)*****

1. Account Management
Are there any existing AWS accounts already in use?
Which account will serve as the Management Account for the Landing Zone setup?
How many accounts or environments (e.g., dev, test, prod) are in scope for implementation?
Do you have specific email IDs that should be associated with each AWS account?

2. Networking
Will this be a Multi-VPC or Single VPC architecture?
Are there existing on-premise data centers or systems involved?
Is any connectivity required between on-premise data centers and AWS (e.g., via VPN or Direct Connect)?
Are there predefined VPC CIDR ranges we need to follow?

3.Identity and Access Management
Is there any existing user management/Identity Management systems?
Integration of existing identity providers with AWS or is it native AWS Directory for user management?
SSO and MFA requirements?
Is there any requirement for custom permission sets for different groups?

4.Security
AWS Config, GuardDuty, VPC Flow Logs, Security Hub, CloudTrail?
Which is the Primary region in scope?
Is there any region restrictions that need to be enforced as part of security requirements?
What are the regions that must be covered under governance of Control Tower?
Is there any specific requirement of custom SCPs to be enabled?

HOW AWS LANDING ZONE WORKS INTERNALLY (Backend Process)

When User Clicks ‚ÄúSet Up Landing Zone‚Äù
Creates AWS Organization
Sets up multi-account structure under a management account.
Creates Core Accounts Automatically
üì¶ Log Archive Account (for storing logs)
üîç Audit Account (for security monitoring)

Applies Guardrails
Sets SCPs and AWS Config Rules via CloudFormation StackSets.

Enables Centralized Logging
CloudTrail & AWS Config are enabled in all accounts.

Logs sent to Log Archive via S3 + KMS.
Sets Up SSO

IAM Identity Center is activated for centralized user access.

---------üîπ When User Creates a New OU or Account (e.g., Dev, Test)
Uses Account Factory (Service Catalog)
Launches a CloudFormation template to create the account.
Places Account in OU
Automatically links it under the chosen Organizational Unit.

Applies Guardrails Automatically
Enforces the same SCPs and Config Rules for consistency.

Deploys Logging, IAM Roles, VPC (Optional)
CloudTrail, Config, IAM roles, optional VPCs set up via StackSets.

Enables Monitoring
Account is monitored for compliance and drift using Config & CloudWatch.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
After Landing Zone Setup ‚Äî What Happens Automatically?

When You Create a New Account via Account Factory (e.g., Dev/Test):
1. üß© Account is Created Inside AWS Organizations
It is assigned under a selected OU (Dev, Test, etc.).
Email ID, account name, and OU are defined during creation.

2. üîí SCPs Are Auto-Applied (Security Control Policies)
SCPs attached to the OU automatically restrict what services/actions are allowed in that account.
Example: You can block use of unapproved regions, services like EC2 Classic, etc.

3. üìú Logging is Automatically Set Up
CloudTrail: Captures all API activity across accounts.
AWS Config: Tracks changes to resources (who changed what).

‚úÖ Both send their logs to the central Log Archive account (via S3 with KMS encryption).
4. üßë‚Äçüíº IAM Roles Are Automatically Created
Predefined cross-account roles:

AWSControlTowerExecution
AuditAccountRole
Used by Control Tower and security team for managing and auditing the account.

5. üßÆ Guardrails Are Enforced
Includes:
mandatory Guardrails (always applied)
Strongly Recommended and Optional guardrails (you choose)
These are implemented using:
SCPs (preventive control)
AWS Config rules (detective control)
Applied using CloudFormation StackSets.

6. üß† Monitoring Is Enabled
AWS Config reports drift and non-compliance.
AWS Security Hub (if enabled) gives centralized security findings.
CloudWatch Logs/Alarms (optional) for runtime monitoring.

7. üîê IAM Identity Center (SSO) Integration
If enabled, new accounts are auto-connected to centralized user login system.
Users get access based on permission sets you define centrally.

üîß Backend Services Working Automatically
Task	AWS Service Used
Account creation	AWS Service Catalog (Account Factory)
OU and Org structure	AWS Organizations
SCPs	AWS Organizations (SCP engine)
Config rules + CloudTrail	AWS Config, CloudTrail
Stack deployment	AWS CloudFormation StackSets
SSO	IAM Identity Center (formerly SSO)
Centralized logging	S3 (in Log Archive Account) + KMS encryption
Security findings	Security Hub (if enabled)

What You Need to Do in the Root (Management) Account to Deploy 2-Tier App

How It Works (Step-by-Step)
üìç Where: Do this in the Management Account (root account)
üîπ Step 1: Create Your CloudFormation Template
Example: A template for 2-tier architecture (VPC, public & private subnets, EC2 in web tier, RDS in DB tier).
File: two-tier.yaml
yaml
Copy
Edit
Resources:
  MyVPC:
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPC
    Properties:
      CidrBlock: 10.0.0.0/16
  PublicSubnet:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Subnet
    Properties:
      CidrBlock: 10.0.1.0/24
      VpcId: !Ref MyVPC
  PrivateSubnet:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Subnet
    Properties:
      CidrBlock: 10.0.2.0/24
      VpcId: !Ref MyVPC
  # (Add EC2 and RDS here)

üîπ Step 2: Go to CloudFormation ‚Üí StackSets (in root account)
Click Create StackSet
Upload your template (or paste inline)
Give it a name like TwoTierAppStack

üîπ Step 3: Choose Permissions
Select:
‚úÖ ‚ÄúService-managed permissions‚Äù
This lets AWS auto-assume roles (like AWSControlTowerExecution) in Dev/Test accounts.

üîπ Step 4: Set Deployment Targets
Choose Organizational Units (OUs) ‚Äî e.g., Dev, Test
Or manually enter account IDs of Dev/Test

you can also:
Choose which region to deploy to (e.g., us-east-1)
Choose parallel or sequential deployment

üîπ Step 5: Deploy
Click Submit.
AWS will now:
Access each target account using the role.
Deploy your 2-tier architecture template.
Show status per account.

‚úÖ What Happens in Dev/Test Accounts:
Feature	Result
VPC created	‚úÖ Yes, per template
Public/Private subnets	‚úÖ Yes
EC2 & RDS	‚úÖ If defined in the template
Stack status visible	‚úÖ In both management and target accounts
Guardrails/Logging	üîÅ Already applied from Landing Zone

Bonus: Update or Delete Easily
Later, you can:
Update the StackSet ‚Üí updates all accounts.
Delete the StackSet ‚Üí removes resources from all accounts.
