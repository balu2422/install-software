AWS WAF is a firewall that helps protect your web applications from common threats like DDoS attacks, bad IPs, SQL injection, and bots.
It works by letting you allow, block, or challenge incoming web traffic based on rules you set.

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) is a type of cyber attack where hackers send too much fake traffic to your website or server to crash or slow it down.



User --> WAF --> ALB --> EC2


How AWS WAF Works ‚Äì Simple Steps
Create an IP Set
A list of IPs you want to allow or block (e.g., block a country or a bad IP).

Create Rules or Rule Groups
Rules define what to check (e.g., block certain IPs, detect SQL injection, etc.)

You can use:
Your own rules (custom)
AWS managed rules (ready-made protection)

Choose Action in Rule
For each rule, you can choose:
‚úÖ Allow ‚Äì Let traffic through
‚ùå Block ‚Äì Stop the request
ü§ñ CAPTCHA ‚Äì Ask the user to prove they're human
‚è≥ Count ‚Äì Just monitor for now, don‚Äôt block yet

Create a Web ACL (Access Control List)
Attach your rules or rule groups
This is the main "firewall" setting you apply to:
CloudFront

Application Load Balancer (ALB)

API Gateway

AppSync

Attach Web ACL to your AWS resource

For example, to your CloudFront distribution or ALB.

üîê Simple Example:
You want to:

Block IPs from 192.168.1.0/24

Allow others

Use CAPTCHA for strange patterns

You will:

Create IP Set for block list

Create Rule: if IP in IP set ‚Üí Block

Create Rule: if request looks strange ‚Üí CAPTCHA

Add both rules to Web ACL

Attach Web ACL to CloudFront or ALB
