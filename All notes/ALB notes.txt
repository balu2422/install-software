What is an Application Load Balancer (ALB)?

Definition: An Application Load Balancer (ALB) is a type of load balancer provided by AWS that operates at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model.
It is designed to distribute incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, 
based on various criteria like HTTP headers, request paths, and more.

How it works:
Traffic Distribution: ALB distributes incoming traffic based on rules you define, such as URL paths, HTTP headers, and query parameters.
Layer 7 Routing: It operates at the application layer, allowing for more complex routing decisions compared to Layer 4 load balancers.
Integration with AWS Services: ALB integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like Auto Scaling, ECS, and Lambda.

Use Cases:
Microservices Architecture: Route traffic to different microservices based on URL paths.
Web Applications: Distribute traffic across multiple instances to ensure high availability and scalability.

2. How does ALB handle SSL termination?
Definition: SSL termination is the process where the SSL/TLS encryption is terminated at the load balancer, and the traffic between the load balancer
and the backend servers is unencrypted.

How to configure SSL termination:

Upload SSL Certificate to ACM:
Go to the AWS Management Console.

Navigate to AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
Click on Request a certificate and follow the steps to upload or request a new certificate.

Create HTTPS Listener:
Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
Select Load Balancers from the left-hand menu.
Choose your ALB and go to the Listeners tab.
Click Add listener.
Select HTTPS as the protocol and choose the SSL certificate from ACM.
Configure the listener settings and click Create.

How it works:
SSL/TLS Termination: The ALB terminates the SSL/TLS connection, decrypting the incoming traffic.
Forwarding Traffic: The decrypted traffic is then forwarded to the backend targets, which can handle the requests without needing to decrypt them.
Use Cases:

Secure Web Applications: Terminate SSL at the ALB to offload the decryption process from backend servers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. How does ALB perform health checks?

Health checks are mechanisms used by ALB to ensure that the targets (e.g., EC2 instances) are healthy and capable of handling traffic.

How to configure health checks:

Navigate to your ALB:

Go to the EC2 Dashboard.
Select Load Balancers and choose your ALB.
Go to the Target Groups tab.
Configure Health Check Settings:

Select the target group associated with your ALB.
Go to the Health checks tab.
Specify the protocol (HTTP/HTTPS), path (e.g., /health), port, and other settings.
Click Save.

How it works:
Periodic Requests: ALB periodically sends requests to the specified path on each target.
Response Evaluation: Based on the responses (status codes), ALB determines the health of the targets.

Traffic Routing: Unhealthy targets are marked and traffic is not routed to them.

Use Cases:
High Availability: Ensure that only healthy instances receive traffic, improving application availability.
Auto Scaling: Integrate with Auto Scaling to automatically replace unhealthy instances.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. What is path-based routing in ALB?

Definition: Path-based routing allows you to route traffic to different targets based on the URL path of the request.

How to configure path-based routing:

Navigate to your ALB:

Go to the EC2 Dashboard.
Select Load Balancers and choose your ALB.
Go to the Listeners tab.
Create Rules:

Select the listener (e.g., HTTP or HTTPS).
Click View/edit rules.
Add rules to route traffic based on URL paths (e.g., /images to one target group, /api to another).
Configure the conditions and actions for each rule.
Click Save.
How it works:

URL Path Evaluation: ALB evaluates the incoming request's URL path.
Routing Decisions: Routes the request to the appropriate target group based on the defined rules.
Use Cases:

Microservices: Route requests to different microservices based on URL paths.
Content Delivery: Serve different types of content (e.g., images, videos, APIs) from different backend services.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. How can I secure traffic between my ALB and my targets?

Securing traffic between ALB and targets involves ensuring that the data transmitted is encrypted and access is controlled.

How to secure traffic:
Use HTTPS:

Ensure backend targets support HTTPS.
Configure HTTPS listeners on the ALB.

Security Groups:
Navigate to EC2 Dashboard.
Select Security Groups.
Create or modify security groups to allow traffic only from the ALB.

How it works:
Encrypted Traffic: Traffic between ALB and targets is encrypted using HTTPS.
Access Control: Security groups restrict access, ensuring only traffic from the ALB is allowed.

Use Cases:
Secure Communication: Ensure encrypted communication between ALB and backend servers.
Access Control: Restrict access to backend servers to only traffic from the ALB.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. How do I configure logging for my ALB?

Definition: Configuring logging for ALB involves enabling access logs that capture detailed information about requests sent to the ALB.

How to configure logging:

Enable Access Logging:
Navigate to your ALB in the EC2 Dashboard.
Go to the Attributes tab.
Enable Access logging.
Specify the S3 bucket where logs will be stored.
Click Save.

How it works:
Log Details: ALB logs details like request timestamps, client IP addresses, request paths, and response codes.
Storage: Logs are stored in the specified S3 bucket for analysis.

Use Cases:
Traffic Analysis: Analyze traffic patterns and troubleshoot issues.
Security Auditing: Monitor and audit access to your applications.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Can I configure multiple listeners on an ALB?

Yes Multiple listeners on an ALB allow it to handle different types of traffic on different ports and protocols.

How to configure multiple listeners:
Navigate to your ALB:

Go to the EC2 Dashboard.
Select Load Balancers and choose your ALB.
Go to the Listeners tab.
Add Listeners:

Click Add listener.
Select the protocol (HTTP/HTTPS) and port.
Configure the listener settings and click Create.

How it works:
Protocol and Port Handling: ALB can have multiple listeners, each using different protocols and ports.
Traffic Management: Allows handling different types of traffic (e.g., HTTP on port 80, HTTPS on port 443).

Use Cases:
Multi-Protocol Applications: Handle both HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
Port-Based Routing: Route traffic based on different ports for different services.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. How can I monitor my Application Load Balancer?

Monitoring an ALB involves tracking its performance and health using various metrics and logs.

How to monitor ALB:
Using AWS CloudWatch:

Navigate to CloudWatch in the AWS Management Console.
Go to Metrics.
Select ApplicationELB namespace.
View metrics like RequestCount, HealthyHostCount, etc.
Create dashboards and alarms as needed.
Enable Access Logging:

Follow the steps in the logging section to enable access logging.

How it works:
Metrics Collection: ALB sends metrics to CloudWatch for monitoring.
Log Analysis: Access logs provide detailed traffic information for analysis.

Use Cases:
Performance Monitoring: Track the performance and health of your ALB.
Alerting: Set up alarms to notify you of any issues.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q10. How to enable monitoring for your Application Load Balancer (ALB) using the AWS Management Console?

Enabling monitoring for ALB involves setting up CloudWatch metrics and alarms to track its performance and health.

Using AWS Management Console:
Navigate to ALB:
Go to the EC2 Dashboard.
Select Load Balancers and choose your ALB.
Go to the Monitoring tab.
View metrics and set up alarms in CloudWatch.
Create Alarms:
Navigate to CloudWatch in the AWS Management Console.
Go to Alarms.
Click Create Alarm.
Select the metric you want to monitor (e.g., RequestCount, HealthyHostCount).
Configure the alarm settings (threshold, period, actions).
Click Create Alarm.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
