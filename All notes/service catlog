 AWS Service Catalog – Simple Steps & Flow
👨‍💼 Step 1: Admin Creates the Service Catalog
The admin (or IT team) sets everything up.

📦 Step 2: Create a Product
A Product is like a ready-made AWS setup (example: EC2 + Security Group + VPC).

While creating a product:

🏷️ Product Name: Give a name (e.g., "Student EC2 Lab")

👤 Owner Name: Add who owns this product (e.g., "Admin" or your team name)

📄 Provisioning Artifact (the actual setup):

You choose either:

CloudFormation Template (CFT)

or Terraform Template

You provide the source:

Upload a .json / .yaml / .zip file

Or give S3 URL where the template is stored

🆔 Version Name: (optional, but good for tracking)

📧 Support Info: Add contact email or phone

🗂️ Step 3: Create a Portfolio
A Portfolio is a collection of products.

Example:

Portfolio: "Student Lab Portfolio"

Product 1: EC2 Lab

Product 2: Web Server Lab

Product 3: RDS MySQL Setup

👥 Step 4: Share Portfolio with Users
Admin attaches IAM Users, Roles, or Groups to the portfolio.

These users will be allowed to see and launch the products.

👨‍🎓 Step 5: Login as User and Use Product
Users log in to the AWS Management Console

Go to Service Catalog

View the allowed products

Click to launch the product

The resource (like EC2) will be created as defined

No need to manually configure

🎯 Final Summary:
Admin creates products using CFT or Terraform

Groups them into a portfolio

Shares with users

Users launch pre-approved AWS setups safely
